    description: '|2-
    * Develop diversity viewmaker networks, which are generative models with stochastic boundaries for data augmentations, via Pytorch Lightning, to adversarially auto       learn and generate augmentations on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor data for self-supervised learning tasks, so as to reduce the rigorous trial and error       by human experts. 
    
    * Develop self-distillation with no labels algorithms for 12-lead ECG data using Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers. 
    
    * Investigate and compare the performance of viewmaker networks to those of other previous contrastive methods, in particular whether viewmaker networks learned         views that are medically sensible, and whether they are more robust to corruptions commonly observed in ECG data collection settings.'

   • Performed sentiment and topic analysis on text behavioral data in a functional neuroimaging study to better understand the relationship between brain functional connectivity and social anhedonia. 
   • Applied machine vision techniques including semi-supervised CNNs, optical flow and open face, on video datasets to analyze group differences in nonverbal synchrony during social interactions among people with schizophrenia and controls. [3] Currently studying patterns of combinations of facial actions to evaluate the effect of oxytocin on patients' social abilities.'

    description: '|2-
   • Utilized unsupervised machine learning algorithms to cluster nursing homes based on the percentage of residents with dementia, depression, and serious mental illness, and detected previously unknown patterns of resident case-mix and staffing in nursing homes. Predicted deficiency scores of nursing homes on a longitudinal basis with supervised learning algorithms. 
   
   • Developed text association and pattern mining algorithms to classify cancer therapies. Combined synthetic minority oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with supervised learning techniques to deal with unbalanced caregiver datasets and help clinicians identify potential mental and physical health risk factors for caregivers of the elder people. Implemented Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to give a non-black-box explanation for ML results in a clinical setting.'
