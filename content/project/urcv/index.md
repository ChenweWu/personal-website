title: Supervised Learning for Cancer Caregiver Risk Prediction
summary: My undergraduate capstone project -- Developed text association and pattern mining algorithms to classify cancer therapies. Combined synthetic minority oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with supervised learning techniques to deal with unbalanced caregiver datasets and help clinicians identify potential mental and physical health risk factors for caregivers of the elder people. Implemented Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to give a non-black-box explanation for ML results in a clinical setting
