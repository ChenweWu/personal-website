title: Unsupervised lyrics style transfer
summary: While interest in text style transfer has grown in recent years, little work has addressed its potential applications to music. In this paper, we investigate an intriguing question: what would a lyric from a Taylor Swift song look like if it were written by Drake, And what would a Drake verse look like if it were penned by Taylor Swift?
