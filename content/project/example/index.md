title: Generative Models for Self-supervised Learning Augmentations in ECG diagnosis
summary:  Develop viewmaker networks, which are generative models with stochastic boundaries for data augmentations, via Pytorch Lightning, to adversarially auto-learn and generate augmentations on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor data for contrastive learning tasks, so as to reduce the rigorous trial and error by human experts.
